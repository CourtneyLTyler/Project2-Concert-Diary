# Approach Taken
* Came up with a concept, feature ideas, and a bonus feature idea (via Pen and Paper)
* Chose needed Models and structured these with properties and types (via Pen and Paper)
* Decided what controller actions were needed and came up with the structure of the routes (via Pen and Paper)
* Created a repository (via Github)
* Structured my root file (via VSCode)
* Installed npm and needed dependencies (via CLI)
* Created the basic file structure of the app (via VSCode)
* Began working on layout/flow of site (via Pen and Paper)

An application that lets users save memories of shows they've attended.  
Users will create an account w/password and email (sign up, sign in, sign out).  They will have a page where they can see all of their saved shows.  They will be able to add new shows and update/delete existing shows.
Possible bonus - upload photos taken at shows?
