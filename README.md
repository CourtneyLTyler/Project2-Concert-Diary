# Project2-Concert-Diary
A full-stack application using MEHN (Mongoose, Express, Handlebars, and Node) with CRUD functionality and RESTful routes, that lets users save memories of shows they've attended.

# Technologies Used
* Text Editor - VSCode
  * used to write the code
*  CLI - Command Line Interface
  * used to interact with files
* npm install
  * used in the CLI to add dependencies
* Express - Node.js web application framework
* nodemon
  * used to restart local server when updates were made (development-side)
* hbs - handlebars
  * used to build semantic templates for views
* body-parser - middleware
  * used to enable the app to read user-submitted form data
* mongoose - Mongodb object modeling tool
  * used to enable the app to interact with the db

# Approach Taken
* Came up with a concept, feature ideas, and a bonus feature idea (via Pen and Paper)
* Chose needed Models and structured these with properties and types (via Pen and Paper)
* Decided what controller actions were needed and came up with the structure of the routes (via Pen and Paper)
* Created a repository (via Github)
* Structured my root file (via VSCode)
* Installed npm and needed dependencies (via CLI)
* Created the basic file structure of the app (via VSCode)
* Began working on layout/flow of site (via Pen and Paper)

# Features

# Unsolved Problems
* Photo uploads
* Expand profile to include upcoming shows

* Fix "choose username" 

# Resources
* I used the file structure from a recently completed lab (GA MEHN Lab) to inform this project.  
* I used GA lessons on Express, Node, Mongoose, and deployment to inform this project.
* Google was my friend
